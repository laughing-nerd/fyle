# Fyle Assignment

This is an assignment for Fyle, created solely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have tried to implement the functionality in a manner similar to how React manages the creation and manipulation of the DOM. Though it is far from what React actually does, I tried to devise my own interpretation.

I have focused mainly on the functionality. The UI is slightly different from what was mentioned in the Notion document.

# Run it locally
To run this locally, you have to first clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/laughing-nerd/fyle-assignment
```
and then cd into it
```bash
cd fyle-assignment
```
Then you can either [open VS code and run it locally using a live-server extension](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-enable-live-server-on-visual-studio-code/), or you can install `live-server` package from npm globally in your system and use it to run the application locally. To install `live-server`, we can do
```bash
npm install -g live-server
```
If you are on linux and you don't have root priviledges, then you have to do
```bash
sudo npm install -g live-server
```
After installing `live-server`, execute the following command to run the application locally
```bash
live-server .
```
